## Utility Programs for E3SM-IO benchmark

* [dat2nc](#dat2nc) -- converts multiple decomposition files into a NetCDF file
* [datstat](#datstat) -- displays statistics of decomposition files.
* [pnetcdf_blob_replay](#pnetcdf_blob_replay) -- converts the subfiles produced
  by the `e3sm_io` benchmark when it ran with PnetCDF blob I/O strategy into a
  regular NetCDF file.

## dat2nc
**dat2nc** is a utility program that converts a PIO decomposition file (in a
text format) to a NetCDF file, which can be fed to `e3sm_io` benchmark to
evaluate the I/O performance.

### Convert the data decomposition file into NetCDF file
The instructions below explain how to convert the data decomposition file into
NetCDF file format.
* For the F case, there are three data decomposition files generated by the
  E3SM production runs, The files are in a text format with file extension name
  ".dat". Converting the decomposition files into a single NetCDF file enables
  the parallel reading. For the G case, there are 6 decomposition files that
  need to be converted first. For the I case, there are 5 decomposition files.
* A utility program, `dat2nc.c`, can be used to convert the text files. Running
  command `make` under to root folder should already build the executable.
* In addition to converting the text-based decomposition map into binary form. 
  The dat2nc utility also converts the decomposition map into the format used by
  the E3SM benchmark.
  + **0 offsets are removed** -
    In the PIO decomposition map, the index starts from 1. The decomposition
    map may contain 0s which means the process did not access any element. They
    are removed in the converted NetCDF file.
  + **Access to consecutive locations is merged** -
    The PIO decomposition map records the variable offset of every element
    accessed by a process. The dat2nc utility converts them into offset and
    length pairs, merging consecutive elements.
  + **The offset and length pairs are sorted according to the offset** -
* The original decomposition map can be included in the NetCDF file by adding
  option `-r`. When enabled, dat2nc will save a copy of the original
  decomposition map in the binary form before applying the conversion mentioned
  above. It is used in the ADIOS blob test cases.
* An example of input file is provided [./input_files.txt](input_files.txt).
  ```
    % cat ./input_files.txt
    ../datasets/piodecomp16tasks16io01dims_ioid_514.dat
    ../datasets/piodecomp16tasks16io01dims_ioid_516.dat
    ../datasets/piodecomp16tasks16io02dims_ioid_548.dat
  ```
* The command to combine the three `.dat` files for the F case to a NetCDF file
  for the F case as an example, is:
  ```
    % ./dat2nc -i input_list.txt -o f_case_866x72_16p.nc
  ```
* Command-line options of `./dat2nc`:
  ```
    % ./dat2nc -h
    Usage: ./dat2nc [-h|-v|-r|-l] -i input_file -o out_file
       -h               Print help
       -v               Verbose mode
       -r               Include original decomposition map
       -l num           max number of characters per line in input file
       -i input_file    list of decomposition file names
       -o out_file      name of output NetCDF file
  ```
* Three small input decomposition files for an F case are provide in
  directory [../datasets/](../datasets/).
  * `piodecomp16tasks16io01dims_ioid_514.dat`  (decomposition along the fastest dimensions)
  * `piodecomp16tasks16io01dims_ioid_516.dat`  (decomposition along the fastest dimensions)
  * `piodecomp16tasks16io02dims_ioid_548.dat`  (decomposition along the fastest two dimensions)
* The NetCDF file converted from these 3 decomposition `.dat` files is also
  provided in the same folder `../datasets` with file named
  `f_case_866x72_16p.nc`. Its metadata is shown below.
  ```

## pnetcdf_blob_replay
**pnetcdf_blob_replay** reads the subfiles produced by the `e3sm_io` benchmark
into a single, regular NetCDF file. Currently, it must be run with the same
number of MPI processes that produced the subfiles. The future work will remove
such limitation to allow less number of MPI processes to convert.

* Command-line options of `pnetcdf_blob_replay`:
  ```
    % ./pnetcdf_blob_replay -h

          [-o file] Output file name
  ```
* Example run:
  ```
    % mpiexec -n 16 ./pnetcdf_blob_replay -i blob_F_out_h0.nc -o F_out_h0.nc
      Input subfile base name            = blob_F_out_h0.nc
